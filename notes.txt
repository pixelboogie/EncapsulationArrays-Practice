
Practice Inheritance in C#

1st Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. Add a MediaType base class to your program.
  a) Add a public field named `Title` of type `string`.
  b) Add a constructor to the MediaType class.
    * Define a parameter named `title` of type `string`.
    * Initialize the `Title` field using the `title` parameter.

2. Update your existing media type classes to inherit from the MediaType base class.
  a) Call the base class' constructor from each of the media type subclasses.

3. Review your media type subclasses and remove any `Title` field definitions from those classes.
  a) Remove any constructor initialization code related to the removed `Title` fields.

2nd Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. Move the `Loan()` and `Return()` methods and the `Loanee` and `OnLoan` fields from the Album subclass to the MediaType base class.

2. Add a `GetDisplayText()` method to any media type subclass that currently doesn't define that method.

3. To test your changes...
  a) Ensure that you're instantiating an instance of each of your media type subclasses in the Program.cs `Main()` method.
  b) Call the `Loan()` and `Return()` methods on each media type subclass instance.
  c) Call the `GetDisplayText()` method (on each media type subclass instance) after calling the `Loan()` and `Return()` methods.

3rd Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. In the Program.cs file, create a static method named `DetectMediaType()`.
  a) Define a parameter named `item` that's of type `MediaType`.

2. In the `DetectMediaType()` method body, use a series of conditional statements and the C# `is` operator to identity which particular media type subclass (i.e. Album, Book, Movie, etc.) the `item` parameter is an instance of.
  a) Once the media type item's subclass type has been determined, output a message to the console that identifies that type.
  b) For example, if the `item` parameter is of type "Album" and its `Title` field is set to the value "Yellow Submarine", write the message "Yellow Submarine is an album!" to the console.

3. To test your changes, pass each media type subclass instance into a call to the `DetectMediaType()` method.

4th Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. In the MediaType.cs file...
  a) Throw an exception in the MediaType class constructor if the `title` parameter is set to `null` or an empty string.
    * Set the exception's message to "A media type must have a title."

2. In the Program.cs file...
  a) Throw an exception in the `DetectMediaType()` helper method when an unexpected media subtype is encountered.
    * Set the exception's message to "Unexpected media subtype encountered."
  b) Wrap the code in the `Main()` method in a `try/catch` statement.
    * Define a parameter in the `catch` clause in order to get a reference to the caught exception.
    * Write the exception's `Message` property to the console.



Running in VS code
----------------------------
to start dotnet in terminal: dotnet new console
it prompted me to add this to the line:  --force
to compile and run my code in terminal use this command: dotnet run
